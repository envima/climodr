\arguments{
\item{envrmt}{variable name of your envrmt list created using climodr's `envi.create` function. Default = envrmt.}

\item{x}{dataframe or path. A data frame containing climate station data or one of the Input paths of the envrmt (either envrmt$path_tabular or envrmt$path_vector)}

\item{pattern}{character. Some string indicating that file is a climate station. E.g. "Climate_Station_*.csv" All climate station files in input folder must contain this pattern in filename.}

\item{metadata}{vector. 5 Entries. Name of your metadata-file in your Input/dep folder, the column name for the climate stations, the name of your X and Y columns and the coordinate reference system. (e.g. c("metadata.csv", "plotID", "lon", "lat", "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))}

\item{time_column}{character. The name of the time column in your climate station data.}

\item{time_format}{character. How is your time column formated? (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD)}

\item{station_ids}{character. The name of the station id column of your climate station data.}

\item{sensors}{vector. Containing all column names of each sensor in your climate station data.}

\item{aggregation_interval}{character. To what format should your data be aggregated? Same as units in [lubridate::floor_date()].}

\item{start}{character. When do you want your climate station data to start?}

\item{end}{character. When do you want your climate station data to end?}

\item{crs}{character. Destined coordinate reference system. If crs = NULL, climod searches for "res_area.tif" in Input/dep.}

\item{sep}{character. Which seperator is used for the columns in the climate station data? (Default = ",")}

\item{dec}{character. Which symbol is used to mark decimal digits? (Default = ".")}

\item{...}{arguments passed down from other functions.}
}
