Description: An automated and streamlined workflow for predictive climate 
             mapping using climate station data. Works within an environment 
             the user provides a destined path to - otherwise it's tempdir().
             Quick and relatively easy creation of resilient and reproducible 
             climate models, predictions and climate maps, shortening the
             usually long and complicated work of predictive modelling.

             Many methods in this package are new, but the main method is based
             on a workflow from 
             Meyer (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108815> 
             and 
             Meyer (2022) <doi:10.1038/s41467-022-29838-9> , however, it was generalized and adjusted in the context of this package.
