To run climodr, you need a PC with a running version of [R](https://www.r-project.org).  
Using an Interface like [R-Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is also strongly recomended.

## Hardware requirements
In theory you can run climodr on every PC setup. Practically we recommend:
* at least 8GB of RAM
* a powerfull CPU for computing models


Depending on the resolution and size of your project Spatial Climate Modelling can be a very intense task for your machine. Running with low-end hardware can slow down your tasks significantly. 

Tooltip from the Author: Gaming-Setups will mostly do the job for you, as Gaming-PCs usually have nice speks for intense modelling and are well optimised.
