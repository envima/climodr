The Environment in climodr serves as a method to setup the same workspace for every usecase of climodr. The idea of this is to make climodr easy to share and reproduce.  
By fixing the folder structure there is only one path a user has to enter. The full project can be zipped and shared with only one line of code to be changed.

The user can also make some adjustments to system specific settings. For example set up the fraction of memory the [terra-package](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/terra-package.html) is allowed to use when doing spatial computation.
