Start learning (or recap) the essentials for working with R and RStudio to create species distribution models.

<!--more-->

To create species distribution models in R, first ensure that R and RStudio are installed on your computer. Additionally, R Markdown will be needed for creating your assignments. Please follow the linked learning resources below according to your level of expertise.
## First steps in R and RStudio

## Working with spatial data in R
To work effectively with spatial data, particularly raster and vector data, it's essential to become familiar with the [**terra**]( https://cran.r-project.org/package=terra) and [**sf**]( https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) packages in R. These packages will be central to handling and analyzing spatial data throughout the course. Take some time to explore their basic functions and documentation.

The online resources for working with **vector data** can be found [here]( https://geomoer.github.io/moer-bsc-project-seminar-SDM/unit03/unit03-02_vector_data.html){:target="_blank"}.

The online resources for working with **raster data** can be found [here]( https://geomoer.github.io/moer-bsc-project-seminar-SDM/unit03/unit03-03_raster_data.html){:target="_blank"}.

Also work through the **example workflow**, which can be found [here]( https://geomoer.github.io/moer-bsc-project-seminar-SDM/unit03/unit03-05_example_SpatialDataProcessing.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Already a spatial data expert in R?
Fantastic! Since youâ€™re already familiar with the basics of spatial data in R, please consider assisting your peers with questions or code debugging as they work through the foundational exercises. If you still have time, explore advanced data visualization. There are many ways and many packages to do this here we will use the [**tidyterra** package]( https://dieghernan.github.io/tidyterra/).
## Advanced visualization (optional)
his section offers a practical exercise for those with a solid foundation in spatial data analysis. You will develop an advanced map in R using the [**tidyterra**]( https://dieghernan.github.io/tidyterra/) and [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) packages to visualize tick bite distribution across Switzerland. This exercise will guide you through adding visual elements to communicate spatial data insights effectively.

Use this time to experiment with advanced plotting in R by creating a map using the [**tidyterra** package]( https://dieghernan.github.io/tidyterra/).

To begin, download the tick bite distribution dataset and verify it by creating a basic plot. Use the provided URL to download the tick bite distribution map, then save it to your chosen local directory.
```r
library(terra)
url="https://data.geo.admin.ch/ch.bag.zeckenstichmodell/zeckenstichmodell/zeckenstichmodell_2056.tif.zip"
file_path="C:/DATA/Lehre/moer-msc-advanced-SDM/data/"
file_name <- "zeckenstichmodell_2056.tif.zip"

# Call the download.file() function, passing in the URL and file name/location as arguments
download.file(url, paste(file_path, file_name, sep = ""), mode = "wb")
# unzip the file
unzip(paste0(file_path, file_name), exdir=file_path)
```
Load the unzipped file into R and create an initial plot using the **terra** package to ensure the data has loaded correctly. This plot serves as a baseline.
```r
# load file into r with the terra package and plot
r=terra::rast(paste0(file_path, "ch.bag.zeckenstichmodell_2056.tif"))
terra::plot(r)
```

Now that the data is loaded and verified, move to** tidyterra** and **ggplot2** to generate a more flexible and customizable plot. Begin by using geom_spatraster() from the **tidyterra** package to map the spatial raster data. If your dataset has multiple layers, you could also use facet_wrap() to separate them.

To give you some ideas for the start here is a basic map with tidyterra:
```r
library(tidyterra)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = r) +
  facet_wrap(~lyr)
```

## Exercise:
Now, create a map with the following features:

* **North Arrow**: Add a north arrow to orient viewers.
* **Scale Bar**: Include a scale bar to indicate spatial resolution.
* **Spectral Color Scheme**: Apply a blue-to-red gradient (blue for low, red for high probability of species occurrence).
* **Rename Raster**: Add a clear header to the raster layer

**Help and Resources**: Have a look at the vignette of [**tidyterra**]( https://dieghernan.github.io/tidyterra/) and also use funcrtionalities of [**ggplot2**]( https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). And in doubt always ask stack overflow.

### Expected output
Your map should look somewhat similar to this:
